## ü§ó About

PHPBuilder is a powerful, modern, and easy-to-use script designed to build specific 
PHP versions from source and install them on your system. Initially developed 
for Debian 11, PHPBuilder is compatible with most Debian and Ubuntu-based systems.

In today's fast-paced digital world, staying up-to-date with the latest PHP 
versions is crucial for optimal performance and capabilities. 
While package repositories like `sury` offer solutions, they often lack the 
flexibility and control that developers and sysadmins demand, 
especially when it comes to security and data privacy.

That's why we at [Neoground GmbH](https://neoground.com) created PHPBuilder ‚Äî an 
open-source project that empowers developers and sysadmins with a simple, 
up-to-date, and fully customizable PHP installation for their servers.

## ü§© Features

- Fetch and build PHP8+ from source, including unit tests
- Provide a modern environment with comprehensive PHP extension support 
- Install built PHP, including PEAR and PECL 
- Install custom PEAR and PECL extensions (currently `redis`, `imagick` and `mailparse`)
- Make handy adjustments, like updating the imagick config for native PDF read/write support 
- Organize config files centralized under `/etc/php` (e.g.: `/etc/php/php.ini`)
- Enable PHP-FPM support via systemd
- Install the latest version of Composer 
- Easily install all required dev dependencies
